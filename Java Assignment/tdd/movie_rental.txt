=Please add code to this project following TDD as closely as possible.

Phase I 
=======

This movie rental application computes total rental cost and total
customer points when a customer rents movies. The movie type can be in 
one of the three: Children, Regular, New Release. In the future, we
might want add more Movie types.  The logic for computing rental
cost and customer point is highly likely to be changed in the future.

-when a customer rents movies, we want to compute the total rental 
    cost and total customer points - Use the skeleton Customer
    and CustomerTest that are provided.
    
-rental amount gets computed as following
   	-Children's movie - $1 per day for the first 7 days and $2 after that 
   	-Regular movie - $2 per day for the first 5 days and $3 after that
   	-New release - $3 per day for the first 3 days, $6 dollars after that
   	
-customer point is computed as following
	-each day a movie is rented, 1 point is added
	-for new release, extra 1 point is added for each day
	
-for each 5 customer points, $0.30 discount gets applied

-we want to generate customer receipt that has customer name, the total 
   rental cost as a simple text. 
   
-make sure "computing individual rental cost" and "computing individual 
   customer point" methods are in the Rental class not in the Customer class 
   - if not, see how you can refactor
   
-See if computing total rental cost and total customer points can be refactored
   to use Java 8 streams and lambda

Phase II
========

-Use strategy pattern for computing rental cost for each movie type
-Use strategy pattern for computing customer points for each movie type


Phase III
=========

-We want to add supporting a new movie type - Cartoon
-We want to display each movie, and days rented, along with total cost, total points 
 in the customer receipt
-We want to generate customer receipt not only in text, but also in 
 HTML, possibly in JSON
-We want to modify the logic of computing customer points for children's movie

 Solution
 ========
 
 -One solution project (up to first requirement of Phase II) is provided 
  as "movie-rental-tdd-final" under "solutions_maven" directory.  It is
  version controlled with git.  You can get a particular version using
  "git checkout <revision>".  The following is the result of "git log --oneline"
