Design a program for the Hollywood Movie Rating Guide, which can be installed in a kiosk in theaters. Each theater patron enters a value from 0 to 4 indicating the number of stars that the patron awards to the Guideâ€™s featured movie of the week.
If a user enters a star value that does not fall in the correct range, reprompt the user continuously until a correct value is entered. The program executes continuously until the theater manager enters a negative number to quit. At the end of the program, display the average star rating for the movie.
