## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code. This repository aims to provide clear implementations of various data structures and algorithms using Java, along with explanations of their usage and complexity analysis. By exploring this repository, you can enhance your problem-solving skills and learn how to tackle coding challenges effectively.

## Data Structures

This section contains implementations of fundamental data structures, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Each data structure comes with detailed explanations of its properties, operations, and use cases. You'll find examples of how to create, manipulate, and traverse these data structures in Java.

## Algorithms

In this section, you'll find various algorithms that cover a wide range of problem-solving techniques, such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer

Each algorithm is accompanied by explanations of its approach, implementation details, and analysis of time and space complexity. You'll also find examples of how to apply these algorithms to solve real-world problems.
